I am to officiate at the wedding celebration taking place at the inn, so I will be there tonight. Do not forget to check the safe because Monday's wages are in it. Send me a message at the fortress if there should be any problems. There are many thieves out and about these days so set the trap just in case you fall asleep, which I'm sure you will. Stay alert!  

                   The Owner, Bornemissza."
