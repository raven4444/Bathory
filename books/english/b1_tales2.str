     Life is a gift that must be given back,
    and joy should arise from its possession.
    It's too damned short, and that's a fact.
     Hard to accept, this earthly procession
      to final darkness is a journey done,
      circle completed, work of art sublime,
      a sweet melodic rhyme, a battle won."
