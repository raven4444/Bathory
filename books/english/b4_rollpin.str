           My friend!
     I managed to get hold of a solid rolling pin. This one is a really well-made one that will not fall apart after a couple of days. It is made from very hard wood. I hit the cook on the head with it when I stole it from the castle kitchen. I'm sending it to you so that you can put it to good use in the same way on the wealthy people in the city. We should be able to get plenty of money from them!"
