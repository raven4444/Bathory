   Here we go again! 
   Whenever the Turks are threatening, I always get into trouble because of my wife's Turkish ancestry. I try to keep myself out of things because of this and just wait for their decision. I hope that Gabor's people are cleverer than this Thurzo, who gets enjoyment from terrorizing women. So, my big armoured friend, I leave you to deal with your politics. The outcome will be decided on the battlefield and it is there you will need me. I will love my wife until then and I do not give a damn about the council. Cachtice fell without the countess."
