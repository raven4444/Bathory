           My beloved aunt!

      I cannot believe what is happening to you but I am convinced that when everything is straightened out, it will all turn out to have been only a misunderstanding on the Palatine's part. When I discovered that you were being confined to a dungeon, I appealed to the King on your behalf and managed to at least get you moved to a decent room until your case has been dealt with. I hope that has made this ordeal a little more bearable for you. Unfortunately, the Turks are threatening again and I must not lose Transylvania. You taught me that my duty to the homeland must come first and personal matters"
page_1: "cannot take precedence over that. I have sent an officer to deliver this letter to you and I hope your guards do not discover it. I hope Thurzo is being kept busy by the Turks because if he is not, the neighbourhood will be in trouble. My messenger is a good friend, but I commanded him not to intervene in your case. Unfortunately we do not have time for this right now but I hope that soon there will be no need. Until then, do not give up but be strong and persistent. If only I could be beside you now, dear aunt.

               Your nephew, Gabor Bathory."
