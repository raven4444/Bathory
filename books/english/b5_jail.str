     I can't wait to speak to you directly as I have to go hunting with the commander. Yesterday evening, we captured a female thief in the slaughterhouse as she was trying to steal the payroll. We don't know who she is or where she comes from as she refuses to speak but she was carrying a strange fencing sword, the kind that is used in the north. I'm sure this will be of interest to the commander so leave her alone in her cell until he's ready to see her. She was carrying some money, which I'm sure was probably stolen, along with quite a few weapons which I will leave here. "
