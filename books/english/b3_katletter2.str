   I may not visit you temporarily because of past circumstances but I am well. I was almost sentenced to death but was lucky enough to escape that fate. Unfortunately the others did not. My life was spared because the countess denied me publicly, which was of course a lie but now we must keep up the pretence in public. It is imperative that no one discover that we are still in close contact. I very much hope that all this will soon end and that then I may go home but there is no doubt that I owe the countess a lot and must remain loyal to her. 

                         Kisses, Katalin."
