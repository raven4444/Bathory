      My dear friend, Janos!

      We did it! Here are the very first volumes in color. They were produced using a couple of primary colours and some insets. Unfortunately the technology is so complicated that duplicating them would be nearly impossible and in any case, very costly. I am sending these as a gift for your library. Take care that the Inquisition doesn't discover them. By accomplishing this feat, we've proved that nothing is impossible. Now we have only to further develop the technology and simplify the process.

           Your friend, Kazmer from Vienna."
