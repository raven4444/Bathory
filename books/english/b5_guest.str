      I am thankful that the garrison could provide me with accommodation for the night. It is very dangerous for an unaccompanied lady to be out in this area after dark and I'm very afraid of the Turkish. Apparently, the Commander is out hunting with the Pasha until tomorrow noon and Palantine Thurzo is expected to arrive here at the garrison, alone. This is very peculiar as people of rank like the Palantine don't usually travel unescorted, unless they are doing something they prefer to remain secret. In any case, there is definitely something going on here. At dusk, while I was walking in the yard, I saw something strange. A man dressed all in black glided into the trees and was met by a servant who handed him something before disappearing through the back door of the castle. Later the same servant left for the village. I wonder if the mysterious person is a thief? Perhaps the servant is his helper?"
page_1: "This happened after the Commander's wife, Lady Uzonka, left for the village, looking slightly upset. I also overheard the guards talking about having caught a girl thief and she was carrying a fencing sword that's the same type that Bathory uses. She must have come here from the north and I don't think she's just a thief. She's probably here for a reason. If I put all these things together, this has all the elements of a conspiracy and it may be related in some way to Countess Bathory's mysterious death. I think I'll take a walk this evening and see if I can find out any more about all these strange events."
