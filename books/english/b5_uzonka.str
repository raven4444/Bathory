    The doctors have told us that I can't have children. As if that wasn't hard enough to bear, my husband has since started cheating on me. Once a month he disappears for the whole night and returns in the morning looking like he has been in a war. He never gives any hint as to where he has been. Only an idiot wouldn't see what's going on. Lately he's become involved with that traitor, Palantine Thurzo, who is responsible for the death of a great woman. He might even be part of a conspiracy and I for one don't intend to die senselessly. Before that happens I'll send him to hell along with his secrets. I know of a man who will kill him for a fee. Perhaps he will accept my last gemstones as payment. I'll visit him tonight to conclude the deal. God forgive me but I have no other choice."
