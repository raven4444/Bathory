     My lord!
     
    I turn to you for help because I am worried about our common friend, Istvan, who lately has been drinking more and more, not only in his free time but also while on duty. Right now, he has shut the door of the elevator room and is lying there on the floor in a drunken stupor. I am afraid that one day he won't wake up from one of these binges. Please remove him from his current position and put him where he'll be observed, otherwise we both stand to lose a good friend.

              With respect, soldier Tanczos."
