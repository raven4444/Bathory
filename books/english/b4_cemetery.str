   I was mistaken when I thought that being given the position of Caretaker for the cemetary was an honour. Since the Countess's burial, strange things have been happening. I see shades wandering around in the cemetery each night but perhaps it is only the grave robbers' latest trick. I've informed the authorities about it anyway and from now on, I'm only willing to stay here in the daytime. Having soldiers here at night is one possibility and in that case it would be best to remove the key from Death's hand."
