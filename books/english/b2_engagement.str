    Dear Endre, I have come to a final decision. Our engagement is over and I will return home immediately. This lifestyle is truly not for me. I have been accosted by your friends and I never want to see the Bailiff again since he made lewd advances towards me in the livingroom while you were drinking with your pals. I believe it is for the best. I'm sorry, don't try to change my mind. 

                      Your ex-bride, Sara.

PS. It is possible that you do not know that the countess has been detained here by your fellows. I hope that you've not had any part in this."
