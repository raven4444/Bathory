THE FIRST ELECTRIC SYSTEM IN OUR COUNTRY.
________________________________________

     Finally the first electrical system, using Charles Georgi's gas and steam technology has been installed in our city. The system is still being fine tuned and there may be occasional problems because of this. Should the system go out, it will be turned back on by the workers in the station. A delay of 15-20 seconds is necessary for safety reasons. We ask the citizens' cooperation and understanding in such an event."
