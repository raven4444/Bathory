  Hunger and poverty have led to a huge increase in the number of thieves. Nothing is safe anymore. I suggested to the lord of the manor that any thieves we capture not be sent to the Fortress prison but be handed over to the Turks instead. They have their own very effective methods of discouraging thieves. His lordship did not agree, however, saying that he would lose his power over Mehadia if he did this, since the Turks are only guests here. If the thieves must go to the prison I have taken extra precautions to make sure they can't escape. I have had an expensive lock installed on the safe, so I'd best not forget the code. I'll pick a number I won't forget... How many cattle can the stable accommodate? This number twice...I won't forget that."
