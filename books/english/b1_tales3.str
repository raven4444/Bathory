        Death is no fearsome mystery.
       He is well known to thee and me.
        He hath no secrets he can keep,
        to trouble any good man's sleep.

     Turn not thy face from Death away.
      Care not he takes our breath away.
      Fear him not, he's not thy master,
        rushing at thee faster, faster.
        Not thy master but servant to
       the Maker of thee, what or Who
        created Death, created thee."
