     Palatine Thurzo was here today to organize the countess' visit for All Souls' Day this evening. He would have liked a prophecy but what I saw in his palm made me deny that I had seen anything. Then, as if he had just remembered something, he nonchalantly asked me about the Octagon legend. He told me he would pay me handsomely to tell him everything I know about it and as a down payment, he dropped a pile of gold coins in front of me. I saw in his eyes that this was not a casual request. He was already aware that I know much about the Octagon. I have no idea how. I had no choice...I had to tell him about it. Unfortunately the Octagon exists in Mehadia and if he stumbles upon it... well, I saw the consequences of this written in his palm."
