          My lady! 

   Some guards planned to search the rooms in your absence. I hid the Indictment in the attic above the archives and I took the Symbol Key with me to the chapel so they wouldn't find it. Fortunately, the warlord heard of the search in time and stopped them. He is a good friend.

       I await you in the chapel but guards are watching me. Be careful.

                                Katalin."
