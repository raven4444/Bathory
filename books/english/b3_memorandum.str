     Elizabeth Bathory was born on August 7th, 1560; her mother lived to be only thirty-one years old before she died in 1570. Elizabeth grew up witnessing many violent acts of torture committed by her father and perhaps her brothers, as they would punish peasants for crimes, according to speculation.
Elizabeth's marriage was arranged when she was still a child, only eleven years old, like many marriages that took place during that era. She was married to Ferenc N dasdy four years after she had been engaged, and had already been living in his castle since their engagement.Her wedding gift from her new husband was his entire castle of Sarvar. Thirty years afterwards, Ferenc purchased the castle of Cachtice and the lands and estates surrounding it from Rudolf II, Habsburg Rudolf, whereupon it became a private family estate.

Despite the severity of the claims he made against Elizabeth Bathory, the response from authorities was delayed. Finally, in 1610, the king sent a military official, Palatine Thurzo, to investigate the circumstances, while also sending two other notaries to collect evidence against Elizabeth. One of them was me. Before Elizabeth's arrest, King Mattias of Hungary negotiated Elizabeth's punishment. She was connected to some of the most influential nobility in the region at the time, rulers and land-owners. Had the king made the decision to execute Elizabeth Bathory, he would have lost favor from various ruling houses, making himself a possible target in a region already torn by considerable internal conflict. When Elizabeth was arrested in December of 1610, the men sent in to collect"
