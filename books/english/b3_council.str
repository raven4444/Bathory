  My lords, since the Turkish threat has become increasingly dangerous we need to come together to work against them. I have sent my strategist with instructions to share our intelligence with you, in an effort to protect our borders. I know that the issues surrounding my mother's situtation have caused some constraint but I am willing to disregard this for now and to concentrate all of my resources on the war. The only way we can triumph against our common enemy, the Turks, is if we co-operate. I need to know immediately if you are willing to do this as there is no time to waste. 
                    With respect! 
         Gabor Bathory, warlord of Transylvania. "
