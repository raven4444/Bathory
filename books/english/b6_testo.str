               TESTAMENT

       I, Elizabeth Bathory, widow of the former strategist Ferenc Nadasdy, declare that I leave all my worldly goods to my three surviving children in equal parts. Furthermore they may dispose freely of any other property left by me once I have departed from this world by God's will.

                             August 31, 1610.
                                      EB."
