Once I captured a traitor who had received 1000 gold for betraying us to the Turks at Bucharest. At that time, I possessed an Ouroboros Trinity amongst my artifacts. I walled up the traitor alive along with his blood money and locked him in with the Ouroboros Trinity. Afterwards, I disassembled the relic into three pieces and hid it in different parts of the castle. Nobody else knows this secret besides me, so I had to make sure that you could find the treasure should you ever have need of it. The walled-up cell is in the crypt and when you open it using the diagram, you will find 1000 gold inside. Use it wisely.
Your husband, Ferenc."
