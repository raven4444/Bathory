     So Mister Gellert take these documents to Mr. Hawkins. I hope that it will be enough to let him silence the doubters. I have descendants today  who have the right to get what they deserve and who still need my help. And so that you do not leave with empty hands, I reveal a last secret. The last chest of gold, the one that Thurzo kept for himself, is hidden in his memorial building. Find it and it is yours in exchange for your work. Or regard it as a gift from me if you prefer.

    Well, good luck Mr. Gellert, I was glad about our encounter.
                                  EB."
