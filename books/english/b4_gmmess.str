       I find it better to stay away from here as much as I can these days. The officers are searching everywhere for the seal that the countess entrusted to me. I'm to safeguard it and hand it over to nobody except Katalin when she comes for it. I've hidden it in a box in the storeroom below the bridge and I've barricaded the door from inside. It should be safe there until Katalin comes for it but if it should accidentally be found, it can in no way be connected to me. The room is accessible only from the stable vent corridor and hopefully it will be some time before the soldiers realise this."
