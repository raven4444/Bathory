In the bazaar they sell many copies of Octagrams. I obtained one of these which I will give to the thief tonight. He will switch it with the commander's real Octagram. It will be worth the 400 gold it cost me. This will be in the commander's best interest too, since having an occult item like this found in his possession would be very bad for him. The thief promised that he will take the amulet far from here to someplace where it will never find its way back into the hands of the pagans. I hope this doesn't backfire, but just in case it does, there is 400 gold hidden at the back of the cabinet that I can use to make my escape."
