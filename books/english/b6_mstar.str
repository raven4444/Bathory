  A monument stands beside the castle of Bittse; a scaffold where the pagans executed six crusaders at one time. They buried the knights under the scaffold and because the knights adored the Morningstar, the Christians erected a Morningstar sculpture in their memory. 
  Father Ponikeus watches over it currently."
