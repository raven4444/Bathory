This measure has been implemented because of reliable information received that a burglary will take place at Thurzo Memorial House. No one is allowed in or out of the city tonight without permission. Furthermore there is now a curfew beginning at 8 o'clock each evening! The guards will severely punish anyone who is found on the streets after this time!"
