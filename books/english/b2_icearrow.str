   I've discovered something very interesting during the last few days. It's a natural miracle which may give us a superb weapon. While I was experimenting with a way to help me make water arrows more efficient with a crystal scrap, I happened to leave a water arrow outside the window. By the next morning, it had frozen into a strange ice arrow. As a joke, I fired it at Barabas and it totally paralyzed him. It took hours of bathing in warm water to thaw him out. I tried another one out on a jackdaw and the bird froze into ice then fell into pieces when I struck it with a stick, just like an icicle. I quickly put three more water arrow crystals in certain places and it works. Another ice arrow formed on the window sill right here."

I still have work to do on it before I can produce them for general use but this weapon is certainly more effective than fire arrows."
