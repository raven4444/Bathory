   Beautiful good fairy, I dream about you all the time. Please help me. I'm just a little girl and my family was banished from the castle by the evil priests. My father was the clerk's clerk, my mother wsa the maid's maid and my brother fought in the battle against the Turks. Now we are so poor while others are so rich. Please leave us just a few coins from the chest that is hidden in the milltower and I will pray for you every night. In exchange for the coins I am giving you the only thing that I have; my ragdoll. Please help me so that when I grow up and work hard, I won't be poor anymore. Sweet dreams dear fairy. I will come back again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next...


Your faithful servant, little Katica."
