  We have arrived at the castle and it is unusually cold and depressing here. I really should not have received this invitation as we were never in the palantine's good graces not to mention those of his conceited bailiff. To think that these people invited us to dinner in a place that is not even theirs! I don't like the sound of that and I suspect that this is part of some plot they are hatching. My biggest problem is that I am a curious man and I like to know what's going on, especially when it doesn't threaten me personally. I will definitely make sure that neither my wife nor myself eat a morsel of dinner just in case they are trying to poison us all. Who knows what they are capable of? I ordered my servant to bring food with us as we have to stay here until morning. This way we can safely see what we would have missed out on if we had simply declined the invitation."
