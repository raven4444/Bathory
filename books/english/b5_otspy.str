      My majestic Pasha!

  I have done as you requested. The Commander's Octagram has been replaced with a fake one and the real one is here in the agreed upon hiding place. I paid an inside servant 400 gold out of my own pocket to obtain the fake and to get me inside. I am sailing back to Istambul right away. I left the 500 gold which you paid me on the armoire. Consider this a favour and remember it for the future should I require your assistance in return."
