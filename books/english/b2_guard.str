    I will deliver this news in person if I survive but I want to write to you in case I don't make it. I am greatly saddened. If you had any idea what kind of strange situation I'm involved in, you would be dismayed. Countess Elizabeth Bathory was arrested and we now guard her in Sarvar. Do not ask me why as I don't know. Nobody knows what is going on. We hear all kinds of monstrous allegations against her but I don't think they are true. It seems to me to be more of a personal vendetta against the Countess and the Palantine. The bailiff is now the castle governor and I do NOT like him. He locked up the servants which I don't believe anyone would have ordered him to do. "

Oh, dear, I really shouldn't talk about this..."
