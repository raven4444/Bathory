          Attention!

      A herd of cattle will arrive soon, but I see that all 74 of the stalls in the stable are already occupied.  Tomorrow morning put all of the butchers to work. That will free up space in the stable and give us a chance to clean it up. We must make sure that we don't run out of quality meat in the near future or the Turks may turn to something else to replace it.
